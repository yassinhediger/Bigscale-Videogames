We are a totally new game producer company and we want to know a little bit more about the actual market (what is selling the most, what type of games user like ...) For the needs of this assignment, we will provide you two datasets with more than 20'000 rows to simulate large scale computation with Tableau. You can download them on our github repository: \n",

        "To reduce the time that you will spend (and our costs), we cleaned already the data using panda library in python.
