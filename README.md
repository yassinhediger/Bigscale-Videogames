## Project choice: Large-Scale Visualization with Tableau

Goal of project: 

Create a tutorial and an assignment (eg for undergraduate students) based on two datasets. Think of the questions that you want to ask. Create an assignment and the solution. Create a video of the solution as a tutorial.

## The datasets

The datasets were found on kaggle. The raw data files can be found in data/rawdata folder. The files needed some cleaning, we already did the work and the data files to be used for the assignment can be found in data/cleandata folder.

`gameuserrankings_cleaneddata.csv`file contains mostly the data about games ratings and user ratings. 
`videogamesales_clean.csv`file contains data about games global rankings, sales, console type, genre, year of release, publisher etc. 

## Instructions

Run `finalassignment.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab to get started with the assignment and follow the instructions. 

## Turotial Video of solution to the assignment
